## I. Introduction

**The objective of the project**: Make a communication and control system that operates the scanner both from far distance through GSM and transfer data from short distance through Bluetooth. 
This system helps users to control the scanner from their android phone:
* Checking basic information: Time, storage, number of images, battery voltage and time + frequency to take picture.
* Change the DPI number (Dots per inch) which is a measurement of imagesâ€™ quality.
* Change time frequency to take picture (ex: every 2 hours, each day or 16h00 everyday).


## II. Sim800

  \end{figure}

Sim800 uses 12V 2A or more power supply with stable performance because Line level for MIC29302AWU is 3A ( You can read about MIC29302AWU datasheet in [**here**](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/20005685A.pdf))
If the amperage is lower than 1A, it will happen to the case sim800 cannot recognize sim ( LED light will blink fast in sequence ). Else, LED light will blink slower and with a delay.
Sim800 only works with Viettel, Mobifone and Vinafone in VietNam.

### A. Sim800 Block diagram

Basic sim supports a lot of different functions like read on ADC or Audio values. Digital pins are used for interfacing with other UART or USB devices in addition to the GPIO pins that are used for the purpose of the programmer. Radio frequency blocks for sim reception via GSM antennas.

### B. Sim800 Schematic

Sim800 is powered by **MIC29302AWU**, sim800 is connected to sim card via SIM800's C7 (I / O) - 15 (SIM_DATA) sim card for data transfer. C3 (CLK) - 16 (SIM_CLK) to carry data. C2 (RST) - 17 (SIM_RST) and C1 (VCC) - 18 (SIM_VDD). Pin 32 (GSM_ANT) is connected to the antenna. 
\
Notice the two pin number 1 (UART1_TXD) and the pin number 2 (UART1_RXD) to communicate with the microcontroller. Microcontroller will communicate with SIM800 by UART communication standard, Sim800 communicates with SIM card with SIM_DATA pin.

* RPI SIM800 Shield provides Dual-band GSM / GPRS 900 / 1800MHz, which can transmit SMS, Data.
* When you connect RPI SIM800 Shield + Raspberry Pi, you power the RPI SIM800 Shield and also power the Raspberry Pi.
* Input power from 9-12V / 2A.
* You can power the PIC SIM800 Shield via a DC power supply, or via the jack on the sim module ( See the figure below )
* If you power the Shield through a DC power supply, you can get a 9-12V output power supply at the bridge.

  \end{figure}

* You can also starte or stoppe the SIM800 via pushbutton on the circuit or use PWK pin control.
* The power source (IC) on the shield allows the user to use the MCU to control the RPI SIM800 Shield, via the C_PW control pin.
  * C_PW = HIGH: The source IC will stop the power supply for RPI SIM800 Shield.
  * C_PW = LOW: The source IC continues to power the RPI SIM800 Shield.
* You can use any Raspberry Pi IO pins to control C_PW pins; The default C_PW pin is connected to the GPIO27 pins of Raspberry Pi, using a jump connection between C_PW and IO27.
